# 👋 Welcome to Skill-Share 👋

Skill-Share is a decentralized application that enables users to exchange skills with each other in a peer-to-peer manner. The dApp provides a platform to connect users with complementary skills, facilitate skill-sharing, and foster learning.

## 🚀 Get Started 🚀

To use Skill-Share, users can sign in to the dApp using their preferred method of authentication such as MetaMask, WalletConnect, or other Web3 wallets. Once signed in, users can take advantage of the built-in chat system to communicate and arrange skill-sharing sessions.

## 💬 Chat System 💬

The chat system is an essential feature of Skill-Share, allowing users to connect and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Users can easily find others with similar interests, share resources, and help each other out. Skill-Share provides a safe and supportive environment to learn new things and foster connections.

## 🔜 Next Steps 🔜

1. Skill Matching: The dApp can use algorithms to match users with complementary skills and facilitate skill-sharing and learning.
2. Skill Listing: Users can list the skills they have to offer and the skills they want to learn on the dApp.
   Rating and Review System: The dApp can have a rating and review system that allows users to rate and review each other's skills and facilitate trust between users.
